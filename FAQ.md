## FAQ

When you find yourself answering the same questions over and over again, that means it should be written down in documentation. That's what this is.

#### What type of environment do you want/need?

I prefer in person, not remote. I like the collaboration of open plan offices. But I think the elbow-to-elbow long shared desks that are trendy at startups pushes it too far. Give me some privacy so my coworkers and I aren't constantly on each others peripheral vision.

I'd like to be able to bike to work and walk around and get fresh air on my breaks.

#### What's your work style?

I'm collaborative, not independent. I need occasional check-ins or well defined, broken down tasks. I would like a culture that supports pair programming or mob programming. I don't hate meetings. I try to be aware of things that cause meetings to drag on unnecessarily but I'm just as likely to be responsible for that.

I'm an educator. I value learning. However much I can teach myself is very limited by my time and how much time I have to utilize what I learned. But if I teach others then that can multiply the value of new skills.

I work at a leisurely pace. I'm reflective of the best ways to do things and I like trying out new ways to see what I like. This has increased my skills and productivity way beyond where I could get by rushing.

#### Weaknesses?

I don't flourish under pressure. I don't want to be on call. Programmers aren't firefighters. That's a sign of mismanagement.

I'm not a morning person. The first thing I do in the morning is the thing I can't put off until later.

#### How can we grift you?

If you have nitro cold brew coffee on draft, I will overvalue that when considering you. Also let me run Linux directly on my work computer. McAfee has wasted enough of my life.

#### What am I looking for?

Zeal. I'm looking for a zealous workplace. Not some place that "does agile" because they were told to.  A place that has tried different ways of doing things and does it the way they do because it works for them. And they're so passionate about it that they proselytize.

My proxy for this has been the use of functional programming languages. I think that attracts a certain type of programmer. I wonder sometimes how much the benefits of FP comes from selecting for this type of programmer. I guess I'm getting at the [blub paradox](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html).
